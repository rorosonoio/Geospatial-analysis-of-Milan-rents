# Geospatial analysis on Milan's rent prices
The aim is to perform an analysis of the rents in the city of Milan, by neighborhood. In particular, this project aims to confirm whether spatial dependance is present in the territory and how an area can influence its neighboring ones (if positively or negatively).
Moreover, after having found the most influential neighborhoods, a study will be performed on the presence of services in some selected areas.

In detail, the project is developed in the following steps, which is the ideal order to view this project:

1. **Data preparation**: this part contains code which shows the methods followed to retrieve data and/or prepare it for further analysis, in order to work as smoothly as possible.
2. **Descriptive spatial statistics**: an analysis is performed to check if spatial dependence is present and how each area influences its neighbors.
3. **Data visualization**: some data visualization is performed in order to view the distribution of the services in the territory of the city of Milan.
